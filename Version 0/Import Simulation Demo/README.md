*****BACKGROUND*****
This is a demo of importing photogrammetry models into the Bevy game engine. Specifically, we're using a car simulation created and provided to us by Chris Patton. 
Doing this manually informs the team of how to design our photogrammetry pipeline, as well as a small glimmer into what our finished program is aiming for.
All changes are within the "car" folder. This includes the entire "assets" subfolder, as well as some code within environment.rs.

*****HOW TO RUN*****
The demo can be ran by entering this into a Linux command line or an equivalent:

cargo run --example car
